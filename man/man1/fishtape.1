.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBFishtape\fR is a TAP (Test Anything Protocol) producer and test harness for fish\. \fBFishtape\fR reads the specified files, or the standard input if no files are given, and executes any \fBtest blocks\fR it finds producing a TAP stream\.
.
.P
This utility also provides a simple mechanism for creating microbenchmarks to measure average utility execution speed\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time=<utility>[,\.\.\.]\fR
Benchmark given \fIutility\fR and/or functions\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pipe=<utility>\fR
Pipe line buffered output into given \fIutility\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show version information\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help information\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-path=<helpers path>\fR
Use given \fIpath\fR to locate preprocessor helpers\. \fBInternal use\.\fR
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Test files are fish files with one or more \fBtest blocks\fR\. A test block consists of an optional description and any test expression supported by \fBtest(1)\fR\.

.SH "SETUP AND TEARDOWN"
.
.TP
\fBsetup\fR
Run before each test in the current file\. Use \fBsetup\fR to load fixtures and/or set up your environment\.
.
.IP "" 4

.nf

set \-l path $DIRNAME/$TESTNAME

function setup
  mkdir \-p $path
end

\fBteardown\fR
Run after each test in the current file\. Use \fBteardown\fR to clean up loaded resources, etc\.
.

.
.SH "VARIABLES"
The following variables are available inside a test file:
.
.TP
\fB$FILENAME\fR
Path to the running script\.
.
.TP
\fB$DIRNAME\fR
Directory name of the running script\.
.
.TP
\fB$TEST\fR
Name of the running script\.
.
.TP
\fB$TAP_VERSION\fR
TAP protocol version\.
.
.SH "METHODS"
The following methods are available inside a test file:
.
.TP
\fBcomment [<message>]\fR
Print a message without breaking the tap output\. This is a wrapper for \fBprintf "# %s\en" >&2\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBpass [<message>]\fR
Generate a passing assertion with a message\.
.
.TP
\fBfail [<message>]\fR
Generate a failing assertion with a message\.
.
.SH "MICROBENCHMARKS"
You can measure average execution speed between functions and/or other utilities using \fB\-\-time=<function>[,\.\.\.]\fR\.
.
.P
This can be useful when trying to compare two or more ways to do the same thing, and we want to know which one is possibly faster\.

.SH "BUGS"
.
.SS "Line Buffered Output"
According to <github\.com/fish\-shell/fish\-shell/issues/1396> redirections and pipes involving blocks are run serially, not in parallel\. This causes \fBfishtape\fR to block the pipeline and buffer all of its output\. To emit a line buffered stream use \fB\-\-pipe=<program>\fR\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Only one expression per test block is allowed\. Use command substitutions to create more complex test expressions\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Each test file is wrapped in \fBbegin; end\fR blocks behind the scenes to protect your local scope\. Also, after each test, global variables are restored to their initial value at the time of running \fBfishtape\fR\.
